# Headline Deadline

## NOTE _Extremely_ Beta 

Your boss sends an urgent Slack message to your team. We need a new viral story this afternoon! You have 20 seconds to come up with the best news headline possible and beat your teammates ideas for fame and fortune!

1. Random headlines will twirl on by
2. Pick one real quick
3. If you don't one will be picked for you
4. You will see any related headlines/links from NYT public API 
5. Can see headlines from co-workers and vote on them

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
