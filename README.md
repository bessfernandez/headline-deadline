# Headline Deadline

## NOTE _Extremely_ Beta 

Your boss sends an urgent Slack message to your team. We need a new viral story this afternoon! You have 20 seconds to come up with the best news headline possible and beat your teammates ideas for fame and fortune!

1. Random headlines will twirl on by
2. Pick one real quick
3. If you don't one will be picked for you
4. You will see any related headlines/links from NYT public API 
5. Can see headlines from co-workers and vote on them

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Done

1. Show intro headline of headline deadline
2. Basic React / UI
3. Animation of headline
4. Figure out parts of speech and get some sort of picking / randomizing going
5. Events to click / timer / all that
6. Fetch related articles from chosen article headline
7. Mock out a leaderboard situation

## Maybe next

- Visible timer
- Make clickable stuff more obvious/visible
- Better intro
- Make things fully randomized
- Fetching is very basic and kinda busted, make it a bit better and explore available APIs more
- Fix for mobile / see if breaking word to next line can be handled a bit better
- Keyboard shortcuts / accessibility (maybe check box for show animation?)
- Get leaderboard vote working/mocked via who knows - Socket io?
- Allow clicking on individual words
- Some better styling
